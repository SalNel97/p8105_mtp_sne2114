### Problem 1

The dog weights dataset includes data on the weights of three pet dogs:
Raisin, Simone, and Gagne. Weight was recorded for each pet in pounds
and ounces along with the standard deviation for weight measurements and
date the pets were weighed. Notes are also included on some dates to
explain things such as missing data for any of the pets, for example.
The goal is to analyze any trends or changes to each pet’s weight as a
way to keep track of any potential health issues.

Import and clean dog weights data set, skipping first header row and
omitting notes column. The column type for the column ‘date’ was changed
to numeric then into date format, since ‘date’ values in excel are
custom (numerically coded) formats, not date formats.

``` r
weights_tidy = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/dogweights_07sept2020.xlsx", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-x6) %>%
  mutate(
    date = as.numeric(date),
    date = as.Date(date, origin = "1899-12-30"))
```

    ## New names:
