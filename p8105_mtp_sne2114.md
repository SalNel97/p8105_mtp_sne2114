Problem \#1

Import and clean dog weights data set, skipping first header row and
omitting notes column. The column type for the column ‘date’ was changed
to numeric then into date format, since ‘date’ values in excel are
custom (numerically coded) formats, not date formats.

``` r
weights_tidy = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/dogweights_07sept2020.xlsx",
    skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-x6) %>%
  mutate(
    date = as.numeric(date),
    date = as.Date(date, origin = "1899-12-30"))
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...6
