### Problem 1

     The dog weights dataset includes data on the weights of three pet
dogs: Raisin, Simone, and Gagne. Weight was recorded for each pet in
pounds and ounces along with the standard deviation for weight
measurements and date the pets were weighed. Notes are also included on
some dates to explain things such as missing data for any of the pets,
for example. The goal is to analyze any trends or changes to each pet’s
weight as a way to keep track of any potential health issues.

     Import and clean dog weights data set, skipping first header row
and omitting notes column. The column type for the column ‘date’ was
changed to numeric then into date format, since ‘date’ values in excel
are custom (numerically coded) formats, not date formats.

``` r
weights_tidy = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/dogweights_07sept2020.xlsx", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-x6) %>%
  mutate(
    date = as.numeric(date),
    date = as.Date(date, origin = "1899-12-30"))
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...6

     Used pivot\_longer to rearrange weight measurement per pet name.
Also helps with not dropping rows with weight data missing from only 1
or 2 pets. The weight column containing both pound and ounce weight
measurements was separated into pound and ounce columns.Same was done to
standard deviation column as well.

``` r
weights_tidy = 
  weights_tidy %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    raisin:gagne,
    names_to = "pet_name",
    values_to = "weight_lbs_oz") %>% 
  drop_na(weight_lbs_oz) %>% 
  separate(
    weight_lbs_oz,
    into = c("weight_lbs", "weight_oz"),
    sep = "\\s", extra = "merge") %>% 
  separate(
    std,
    into = c("std_lbs", "std_oz"),
    sep = "\\s", extra = "merge") %>% 
   relocate(date, pet_name, weight_lbs, std_lbs, weight_oz, std_oz)
```
